# Work in Progress 

Instant Messenger Project

The MVP for this project is to have an application where users can log in/register, add/remove friends, and message people in their friends list.

Currently learning MongoDB for this project, so I might be a little slower when it comes to building it.

Let me know if you have any questions!
